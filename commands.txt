In order to create anything, you can just use artisan commands, so:

php artisan make:[type] [name]

Where type can be 'model', 'controller', 'migration', 'middleware', and so much more,
and name is just the name.
You might need to run this with "sudo" priveleges

Example:
I want to make a Model and a controller for it. The model will be called "Derp".
  sudo php artisan make:model Derp
    ^ This will create a model as app/Derp.php

  sudo php artisan make:controller DerpController
    ^ This will create the controller as app/Http/Controllers/DerpController.php

DATABASE MIGRATIONS

In order to actually store user data we need to create tables for it.
The command to make a migration is:

php artisan make:migration [name] [--params]

Where name is the name of the migration such as "create_users_table",
and params is the type of migration [create vs table] (params is optional)

Example:
I want to create a new table for the existing Model "Derp"
  sudo php artisan make:migration create_table_for_derp --create=derps
  ^ Note that derps is plural, since it will store multiple derps

I want to modify the Derp table because I want to add something new
  sudo php artisan make:migration add_herp_to_derp --table=derps
  ^ Should be self explanatory
